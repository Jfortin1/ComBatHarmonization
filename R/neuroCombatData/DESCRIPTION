Description: Provides a multi-site cortical thickness measurements
    (263 subjects across 9 sites). Data were simulated based on a 
    subset of the UCSF FreeSurfer cross-sectional cortical thickness
    processed data.The goal of the simulation was to create a dataset
    that mimics both the technical variability and biological
    variability observed in a in real-world study. multi-site ADNI
    cortical thickness measurements dataset. Data were obtained from
    the UCSF cross-sectional FreeSurfer (6.0) analysis. Imaging features
    (ROIs) correspond to the featured measured in the FreeSurfer
    software (v6.0).
